## Customization

### To Change Salary Ranges:

Edit `seedPayrollSettings()` function in `/src/seed/index.ts`:

```typescript
const salaryRanges: Record<string, number> = {
  'HR Manager': 12000,
  'Department Manager': 10000,
  // ... modify as needed
}
```

### To Add More Inventory Items:

Edit `seedInventory()` function:

```typescript
const laptopModels = [
  'MacBook Pro 16" M3 Pro',
  // ... add more models
]
```

### To Adjust Leave Frequency:

Edit `seedLeaves()` function:

```typescript
const numLeaves = Math.floor(Math.random() * 5) + 1 // Change from 3 to 5
```

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Authentication**: All Marvel characters have their emails as login credentials. You'll need to set passwords manually or via the forgot password flow.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Multi-Department Access**: Department managers can see all users who share ANY of their departments. This is intentional for the multi-dimensional structure.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Payroll Auto-Generation**: When you create new payroll records, they will automatically populate items from PayrollSettings.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Unique Serial Numbers**: All inventory items have unique serial numbers. Don't manually create items with the same serial numbers.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cannot find departments"

**Solution**: Make sure `roles-departments.ts` seed runs first. It creates all departments.

### Issue: "Duplicate key error on email"

**Solution**: Clear the database before reseeding:

```bash
# Drop and recreate the database, then run seed again
```

### Issue: "Payroll items not generated"

**Solution**: Ensure PayrollSettings are created before Payroll records. The seed runs in correct order.

### Issue: "Type errors in seed file"

**Solution**: Run type generation:

```bash
pnpm run payload generate:types
```

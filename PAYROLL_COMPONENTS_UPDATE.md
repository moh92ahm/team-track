# Payroll Components Update

## Summary

Updated the payroll table component and sidebar navigation to work with the new PayrollSettings-based system.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Payroll Table Component** (`src/components/payroll/table.tsx`)

#### **Columns Updated:**

**Old Columns:**

- Employee
- Period
- Work Days (daysWorked/totalWorkingDays)
- Gross Pay (from calculations.grossPay)
- Net Pay (from calculations.netPay)
- Status

**New Columns:**

- Employee
- Period
- Items (count of payrollItems)
- Total Amount (from totalAmount field)
- Adjustments (bonusAmount/deductionAmount)
- Status

#### **Key Changes:**

1. **Removed Work Days Column**:
   - Old system tracked `workDays.daysWorked` and `workDays.totalWorkingDays`
   - New system doesn't use work days tracking

2. **Removed Gross/Net Pay Columns**:
   - Old system calculated `calculations.grossPay` and `calculations.netPay`
   - New system uses `totalAmount` which is auto-calculated from payroll items + adjustments

3. **Added Items Column**:
   - Shows count of `payrollItems` array
   - Example: "3 items" means 3 different payment types (salary + bonus + allowance)

4. **Added Adjustments Column**:
   - Shows manual adjustments: bonuses (+) and deductions (-)
   - Example: "+â‚º500 -â‚º200" means â‚º500 bonus and â‚º200 deduction
   - Shows "-" if no adjustments

#### **Data Structure Mapping:**

```typescript
// OLD STRUCTURE
{
  employee: User,
  period: { month, year },
  workDays: {
    totalWorkingDays: 22,
    daysWorked: 20,
    leaveDays: 2
  },
  calculations: {
    grossPay: 8000,
    netPay: 7200
  },
  status: "paid"
}

// NEW STRUCTURE
{
  employee: User,
  period: { month, year },
  payrollItems: [
    {
      payrollSetting: PayrollSetting,
      description: "Monthly Salary",
      payrollType: "primary",
      amount: 7000,
      paymentType: "bankTransfer"
    },
    {
      payrollSetting: PayrollSetting,
      description: "Performance Bonus",
      payrollType: "bonus",
      amount: 1000,
      paymentType: "bankTransfer"
    }
  ],
  adjustments: {
    bonusAmount: 500,
    deductionAmount: 200,
    adjustmentNote: "Performance bonus"
  },
  totalAmount: 8300, // Auto-calculated: 7000 + 1000 + 500 - 200
  status: "paid"
}
```

### 2. **Sidebar Navigation** (`src/components/app-sidebar.tsx`)

#### **Added Expandable Payroll Menu:**

```typescript
{
  title: 'Payroll',
  url: '/payroll',
  icon: IconCreditCard,
  items: [
    {
      title: 'Payroll Records',
      url: '/payroll',
    },
    {
      title: 'Payroll Settings',
      url: '/admin/collections/payroll-settings',
    },
  ],
}
```

**Features:**

- Clicking "Payroll" expands to show submenu
- "Payroll Records" â†’ `/payroll` (main payroll page)
- "Payroll Settings" â†’ `/admin/collections/payroll-settings` (Payload admin)

### 3. **NavMain Component** (`src/components/nav-main.tsx`)

#### **Added Support for Nested Menu Items:**

**New Features:**

1. **Collapsible Menu Items**: Items with `items` array become expandable
2. **Chevron Icon**: Rotates when expanded/collapsed
3. **SubMenu Support**: Proper nesting with `SidebarMenuSub` components
4. **TypeScript Types**: Updated to support optional `items` array

**Usage:**

```typescript
// Simple menu item (no subitems)
{
  title: 'Dashboard',
  url: '/',
  icon: IconDashboard,
}

// Expandable menu item (with subitems)
{
  title: 'Payroll',
  url: '/payroll',
  icon: IconCreditCard,
  items: [
    { title: 'Payroll Records', url: '/payroll' },
    { title: 'Payroll Settings', url: '/admin/collections/payroll-settings' },
  ],
}
```

## Migration Notes

### If You Have Existing Payroll Data:

The old payroll structure (`workDays`, `calculations.grossPay`, `calculations.netPay`) is no longer used.

If you have old payroll records in the database, you'll need to:

1. Create PayrollSettings for each employee
2. Migrate old payroll records to new structure with `payrollItems`
3. Or clear old records and re-seed with new structure

### Recommended Approach:

Since you just seeded the database with Marvel characters, you should have fresh data with the new structure. If you have old data, consider clearing it and reseeding.

## Summary

âœ… Payroll table updated to show Items, Total Amount, and Adjustments
âœ… Sidebar now has expandable Payroll menu with Settings link
âœ… NavMain component supports nested menu items
âœ… Components aligned with new PayrollSettings-based system
âœ… Better UX and data visibility

The payroll system is now fully updated to work with the new structure! ðŸŽ‰
